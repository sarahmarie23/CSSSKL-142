## 🔑 Key Points 🔑

    1. 1D Arrays
    2. 2D Arrays
    3. Iterate over an array
    4. Fill an array

## 🏘️ 1D Arrays : Our first data structure

* We can store a piece of information in a String, int, char. But what if we want to store a *collection* of Strings, ints, or chars?
* This is where arrays and data structures come in
* You can quickly access elements in the array, given its index

### Properties of arrays

* Need to initialize with the data type or size declared, and it cannot change
* Must contain the same type of object (example: all Strings)
* Arrays use 0-indexing
* Can get the length using `length`

> Imagine you are going to your friend's house. You don't remember their exact address, but you know they live in the 3rd house down from the corner of H Street and 10th Street. You can put those cross streets into your phone, and just count 3 houses over to get to their house. 
>
> You remembered the start of the street in order to get to your friend's house. The array is accessed by going to the address of the first element, and the index is how many spaces away from the beginning you need to get to.

### Initializing arrays

* Method 1: With elements declared

* Method 2: Without elements
